# When Violence Doesnâ€™t Leave a Mark: The Hidden Majority of Domestic Violence Cases in Colorado

The goal of this project is to compare the number of non-physical injuries vs. physical injuries resulting from domestic violence incidents between urban and suburban counties in Colorado using publicly available crime statistics.
