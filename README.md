# Exploring Domestic Violence Injuries in Colorado

A relatively small amount of domestic violence cases in Colorado have recorded injuries. The majority of cases reported injuries as 'none' or 'apparent minor injury.' The goal of this analysis is to find out if this pattern differs between suburban and urban counties. This could show patterns that are representative of underreporting, differences in classification between counties, or uneven support based on urban or suburban geographic areas. This analysis uses SQL and R for basic data cleaning, and regional trend visualization using Tableau.

## Key Questions

- Are injury patterns different in urban vs rural counties?
- Which injury types are most reported, and how have they changed from 2020–2024?

## Summary of Methods

- Cleaned and reshaped wide-format injury data (2020–2024)
- Merged with manually classified county list from DOLA
- Analyzed regional injury totals and time trends using R and ggplot2
